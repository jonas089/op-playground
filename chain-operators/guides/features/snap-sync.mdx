title: Using snap sync for chain operators
description: Learn how to enable snap sync on your OP Stack chain.
---

Snap sync significantly improves the experience of syncing an OP Stack node. Snap sync is a native feature of go-ethereum that is now optionally enabled on `op-node` & `op-geth`.
Snap sync works by downloading a snapshot of the state from other nodes on the network and is then able to start executing blocks from the completed state rather than having to re-execute every single block.
This means that performing a snap sync is significantly faster than performing a full sync.

*   Snap sync enables node operators on your network to sync faster.
*   Snap sync removes the need for nodes on your post Ecotone network to run a [blob archiver](/node-operators/guides/management/blobs).

## Enable snap sync for chains

To enable snap sync, chain operators need to spin up a node which is exposed to the network and has transaction gossip disabled.
This node will serve snap sync requests on the execution layer from other nodes on the network.

<Info>
For snap sync, all `op-geth` nodes should expose port `30303` TCP and `30303` UDP to easily find other `op-geth` nodes to sync from. 
  *   If you set the port with [`--discovery.port`](/node-operators/reference/op-geth-config#discovery-port), then you must open the port specified for UDP.
  *   If you set [`--port`](/node-operators/reference/op-geth-config#port), then you must open the port specified for TCP.
  *   The only exception is for sequencers and transaction ingress nodes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup a snap sync node">
  *   Expose port `30303` (`op-geth`'s default discovery port) to the internet on TCP and UDP.
    *   Disable transaction gossip with the [`--rollup.disabletxpoolgossip`](/node-operators/reference/op-geth-config#rollupdisabletxpoolgossip) flag
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable snap sync on your network">
  *   Follow the [Node operator snap sync guide](/node-operators/guides/management/snap-sync) to enable snap sync for your chain network.
